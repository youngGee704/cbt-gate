Computer-Based Test Scheduling &amp; Management System


Project Goal: Develop a secure, scalable, and intuitive web application named "CBT-Gate" to completely eliminate overcrowding and enhance safety during Computer-Based Tests (CBTs) at Nasarawa State University, Keffi (NSUK). The system will automate exam scheduling, assigning unique time slots, seat numbers, and sessions to students, enforcing strict adherence to schedules, and providing robust administrative control.
